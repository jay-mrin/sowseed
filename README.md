# Sow Your Seed

A personalised digital-writing order page with Supabase backend support, dual-account PayPal Checkout, role-based admin controls, posts, likes, comments, order calendars, and a fortune message after confirmed payment capture.

## What Runs Locally

The page can still run as a static frontend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:5173`.

When `src/config.js` has `backendEnabled: false`, the app stays in local demo mode. When Supabase values are filled and `backendEnabled: true`, public data, goal settings, posts, orders, likes, comments, and PayPal checkout are loaded through Supabase Edge Functions.

Both portals show the combined total of Admin- and SuperAdmin-route page visits from the last 24 hours. Every payment attempt and completed payment remains visible only in the portal for the checkout route that owns it. Each portal uses its own reset timestamp, so resetting one dashboard does not affect the other.

The payment column includes a Blessing Wall loaded from `seed_comments`. Initial comments are imported from legacy data, and completed public Admin-routed orders can add a new comment with the captured payment timestamp.

## Files

- `index.html` - static app entrypoint
- `src/app.js` - frontend state, Supabase calls, PayPal SDK wiring
- `src/adsense.js` - backend-controlled Google AdSense loader shared by public pages
- `src/styles.css` - responsive UI and modal styling
- `src/config.js` - local browser config, never store secrets here
- `.env.example` - server secret placeholders
- `supabase/migrations/*` - database, RLS, storage bucket, seed/order data
- `supabase/functions/*` - public, admin, PayPal, and engagement Edge Functions

## Required Setup

1. Copy `src/config.example.js` to `src/config.js` and fill:
   - `supabaseUrl`
   - `supabaseAnonKey`
   - `backendEnabled: true`

   PayPal client IDs are provided by the backend for the selected Admin or SuperAdmin route. Do not put PayPal client secrets in browser configuration.

2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for your local notes only. Do not commit real secrets.

3. Install tooling:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Link your Supabase project and push the migration:

```bash
npx supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
npx supabase db push
```

5. Add Supabase Auth users, then assign each account the required role:

```sql
insert into public.admin_profiles (user_id, email, role)
values ('YOUR_AUTH_USER_ID', 'you@example.com', 'admin')
on conflict (user_id) do update set email = excluded.email, role = excluded.role;

insert into public.admin_profiles (user_id, email, role)
values ('YOUR_SUPERADMIN_AUTH_USER_ID', 'superadmin@example.com', 'super_admin')
on conflict (user_id) do update set email = excluded.email, role = excluded.role;
```

6. Set Edge Function secrets:

```bash
npx supabase secrets set SUPABASE_URL="https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co"
npx supabase secrets set SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"
npx supabase secrets set PAYPAL_ENV="sandbox"
npx supabase secrets set PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_SANDBOX_CLIENT_ID"
npx supabase secrets set PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_SANDBOX_CLIENT_SECRET"
npx supabase secrets set PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID="YOUR_SANDBOX_WEBHOOK_ID"
npx supabase secrets set SUPER_ADMIN_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_SUPERADMIN_SANDBOX_CLIENT_ID"
npx supabase secrets set SUPER_ADMIN_PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_SUPERADMIN_SANDBOX_CLIENT_SECRET"
npx supabase secrets set SUPER_ADMIN_PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID="YOUR_SUPERADMIN_SANDBOX_WEBHOOK_ID"
npx supabase secrets set PAYPAL_CURRENCY="USD"
npx supabase secrets set SUPERADMIN_PURGE_PASSWORD="YOUR_STRONG_PURGE_PASSWORD"
npx supabase secrets set SITE_ORIGIN="http://127.0.0.1:5173"
```

Use the deployed website origin for `SITE_ORIGIN` outside local development.

7. Deploy functions:

```bash
npm run supabase:deploy
```

## PayPal Notes

This app uses PayPal Orders for one-time payments and PayPal Subscriptions for weekly sowing. A separate blue card option appears only for one-time checkout and opens the separately hosted alternate checkout website inside a same-page popup. After it is used, it turns gray and is disabled for the rest of the page session.

The PayPal SDK is never preloaded. When a customer opens checkout, the app refreshes the server-selected payment route, removes any previous PayPal SDK instance, displays the rotating seed loader, and loads a new SDK instance. PayPal buttons remain hidden until each eligible button has rendered a visible iframe.

For your India-registered PayPal Business account, test with PayPal sandbox buyer accounts before switching to live credentials.

SuperAdmin chooses whether payments use the Admin or SuperAdmin PayPal account. The optional `$21 or more` override always routes qualifying payments to SuperAdmin. Admin uses `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID`, `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID`; SuperAdmin uses the corresponding `SUPER_ADMIN_PAYPAL_*` secrets.

A valid email address is required at checkout so the order can be delivered. Display name and message remain optional for one-time payments; a customer name and whole seed count are required for Weekly. After form validation, the customer chooses a one-time offering or a weekly PayPal subscription.

Weekly subscriptions charge the selected seed amount immediately as the plan setup fee. Regular billing starts on the next applicable Monday at 6:00 PM `Asia/Kolkata`; a subscription created on Monday starts regular billing the following Monday. PayPal may retry failed renewal payments outside the Monday schedule. Failed, retrying, and suspended subscriptions remain under Pending until payment recovers or the receiving account owner cancels them.

Both PayPal apps must send `PAYMENT.SALE.COMPLETED`, `PAYMENT.SALE.REFUNDED`, `PAYMENT.SALE.REVERSED`, `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.CREATED`, `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.ACTIVATED`, `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.UPDATED`, `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.EXPIRED`, `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.CANCELLED`, `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.SUSPENDED`, and `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.PAYMENT.FAILED` to the deployed `paypal-webhook` URL. Keep the route-specific webhook IDs in the existing PayPal secrets.

The public meter is a repeating goal cycle, separate from the complete order calendar. Admin sets the goal amount and current cycle amount in dollars. With `$7 = 1 seed` and a `$700` goal, the target is `100 seeds`; a `$7` order adds `1%`, a `$14` order adds `2%`, and custom amounts contribute as `amount / 7`. When the current cycle reaches `$700`, the visible meter resets to `0%` and starts the next cycle.

Admin can enable or disable Google AdSense under Site settings. The setting is public, applies across the main and legal/information pages, and takes effect for new page loads.
The static `google-adsense-account` meta tag and root `ads.txt` record remain available for Google site ownership verification; neither marker loads ads when the admin setting is disabled.

Every completed PayPal capture also creates a linked digital-service order for `Personalised Digital Writing - Custom Order Made Writing`. The calendar for the collecting role shows the order ID, PayPal transaction ID, personalised-writing request, fulfillment status, and a proof PDF download for each payment.

## Verification

Run the local validation suite before deployment:

```bash
npm run check
```

Use PayPal sandbox first:

- Successful wallet capture creates one donation row and returns a fortune.
- Debit or credit card checkout redirects to the configured alternate checkout website.
- Cancelled checkout creates no donation.
- Duplicate capture/webhook updates do not create duplicate donations.
- The Once/Weekly dialog opens only after valid seed details and closes through Not now, Escape, or backdrop selection.
- Weekly approval creates one subscription, and every verified subscription sale creates exactly one linked seed order.
- Admin and SuperAdmin subscription calendars show only their own Active, Pending, and Cancelled customers.
- Admin calendar can download a proof PDF for each digital-service order and mark orders fulfilled.
- Both analytics portals share the total page-visit count while keeping every payment attempt and completed payment private to its checkout owner. Each portal resets independently.
- Public Blessing Wall loads imported legacy comments and appends paid blessing requests after confirmed payment capture.
- Admin login requires Supabase Auth and `admin_profiles`; Admin and SuperAdmin see only the orders routed to their respective collection account.
- Donor comments require the same-browser donor token returned after a completed donation.
